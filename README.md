This assignment includes two implementations for processing car sales data:
  Python implementation
  C++ implementation

Both implementations perform the following tasks:
  Count the number of cars sold by Audi in China in 2025
  Calculate the total revenue generated by BMW in 2025
  Compute the revenue distribution across European countries and sort them from highest to lowest

Running the Python Implementation
  Navigate to the pythonImplementation folder and run:
  python3 main.py

Navigate to the cppImplementation folder and compile the project using:
    g++ main.cpp countCars.cpp revenueCars.cpp distribution.cpp loadCsv.cpp -o mainfile
Then run the executable:
    ./mainfile
